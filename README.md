## Linear Regression

This section demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression. The code includes steps to load a dataset, visualize data, train a linear regression model, and evaluate the results.

## Gradient Descent + Cost Function

This section covers gradient descent with a cost function for linear regression. It showcases the process of data visualization, splitting, model training, and evaluation using the gradient descent algorithm.

## Logistic Regression

The logistic regression section showcases binary classification using logistic regression. It explains how to load and visualize data, split it into training and testing sets, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Logistic Regression Multi

Here, logistic regression is applied to multi-class classification. The code demonstrates the process of loading data, visualizing digits, splitting data, training the model, and evaluating the results.
